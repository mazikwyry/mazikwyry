# Adam Mazur README 

v. 0.1 (2023-09-06)

ðŸ‘‹ Hi I'm Adam. Husband of 1, father of 4. 

## General
- I love **people**. I love people more than technology. 
  I like how we are different and I'm curious to know what motivates people to behave in a certain way.
- Core personal values
  - **Love** - meaning: sharing myself (what I got) to grow others, so they also love (this is super hard)
  - **Truth** - it frees us up! 
  - **Transparency** - I believe that transparency is the key to building trust and trust is the key to building fulfilling relationships
- I'm a very approachable and open person. It's extremely hard or impossible to offend me. 
- I value people who give me **constructive/candid feedback** (I'm fine with direct or even brutal-truth ones).
- I'm not a "serious guy". I like to make people laugh. I love **jokes** (I usually make dad/bad jokes). I never intend to offend anyone. If I do, let me know.

## Communication
- **If you write a comment in Gitlab and expect me to read it please mention me `@adam.mazur`.** Otherwise there is a high chance I'll miss it because I have all email notifications from Gitlab filtered out.
  GitLab doesn't allow you to setup notifications only about threads in which you participated. It's more all of nothing. I decided "nothing" to keep my inbox manageable.
  I get notifications about every mention on Gitlab via Slack using this script
- I have my **slack notifications always disabled**. I check Slack when I have time for it. I don't want to be interrupted by Slack notifications. I want to be in control of my time.
  - If you really need me now (which might happen) don't hesitate to force a notification on Slack or just text me (SMS, WhatsApp are ok)
- **Async** is my preferred communication mode. 
- I like meetings (especially in person). Especially with a clearly defined outcome. I totally **don't mind ad-hoc huddles** (don't hesitate to ask for one!) Slack/Zoom? - doesn't matter.

# Work
- At work I mostly like:
  - **Working with people on solving problems** - I love to work with the product team to understand the problem and come up with a solution. Then translate this to the engineering team and work with them to deliver the solution.
  - **Growing people** - Code reviews, presentations, blog posts, writing documentation (_What?! Yes, I like this very much_), videos, mentoring, coaching (although I'm barely starting my coaching journey)
  - **Facilitate** - I love to facilitate meetings, workshops, and discussions.
  - **Solution design** - I like designing complete solutions, smaller and bigger architectures - ideally together with other people different from me.
  
- When writing/reviewing code I mainly care about:
  - **Readability** - Or maybe more precisely "future readability". Will the person 6 months from now be able to understand **what** I wrote and **why**?
    I'm trying to reduce WTFs/minute. I'm the one who would suggest leaving a comment if the code is not self-explanatory (sometimes it's just easier to write a comment).
  - **Maintainability** - I believe that you can call the code good only after you attempt to change it. If it's easy to change it's good.
  - **Visibility** - If 2 things are somehow connected I want other people to know this when they look at one of them.
  - **Consistency** - I like to keep things consistent. If people see multiple ways of doing one thing, they lose time in deciding which one to use.
  
  So as you see when it comes to code **I mainly care about people that will work with it in the future**. 
  Those people will work for the same company, so by saving pain and time for them I'm saving money for the company.
- I value **quality** over speed. However, I'm more than happy to take shortcuts if we agree to refactor/fix/remove that after some exact time (hack-deadline)

# Misc
- I don't like to talk about work after work
- I tend to be late at meetings (I'm working on it) - Start without me or ping me on slack/phone after 5 min
- I like 1:1s to be 50/50 personal/work related
